# Furina Memory Reflection

Read `$ARGUMENTS` as the transcript or notes to analyze. Output valid JSON only. Do not include Markdown fences or explanatory text.

Use the schema from `src/prompt/reflection.md` and `src/memory/memory_format.md` when needed.

## Extraction Rules

- Add at most 5 new memories.
- Keep each memory `content` as one concise declarative sentence.
- Prefer long-term value over one-off details.
- Include `obsolete_ids` when correcting stale memories.
- Do not save sensitive medical, financial, identity, or location data unless the user explicitly asks.

After generating JSON, the user can merge it with:

```bash
node scripts/furina-memory.mjs remember --reflection <reflection.json>
```
