# Furina Memory Compression

Prefer the shared runtime:

```bash
node scripts/furina-memory.mjs compress
```

If the repository runtime is unavailable, try `node ~/.claude/furina-memory.mjs compress`.

## Manual Fallback

If no runtime is available, read `~/.claude/furina-memory.json` and apply `src/memory/compression.md` as a proposal workflow: produce the compressed JSON and a short change summary for user confirmation. Do not overwrite the memory file manually unless the user explicitly approves that fallback write.

Compression priorities:

- Preserve high-priority memories.
- Merge duplicates and near-duplicates.
- Remove low-value one-off details.
- Keep wording concise and stable.
- Report before/after counts and the most important retained themes.
